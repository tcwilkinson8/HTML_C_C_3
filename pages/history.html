          <h3>🏰 Founding Years (c. 990–1490s)</h3>
          <p>The birth of inter-house Quidditch saw Gryffindor fielding fierce, fast teams—relying on raw talent over tactics. Their enchanted golden hoops were among the first standardized pitch elements. Notably, Sir Godric himself once took to the skies for ceremonial matches.</p>

          <h3>🔥 The Golden Era (1970s–1990s)</h3>
          <p>Nicknamed "The Scarlet Storm," Gryffindor dominated the house leagues during this stretch with seven House Cup wins in twelve years. That era included players like Lee Jordan (commentator-turned-beater), a brief Weasley dynasty, and a long-running unbeaten home streak. Still, a few years of narrow final losses plagued the mid-80s.</p>

        <article class="era-block">
          <h3>🌫 Modern Day (1999–Present)</h3>
          <p>Once feared, now rebuilding. The team has endured low-scoring seasons, a cursed batch of broomsticks, and a tragic Snitch-chasing mix-up during the infamous 2014–2015 final vs. Ravenclaw. Still, loyal fans chant “We fly again.”</p>
